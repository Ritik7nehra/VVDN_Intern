## Regression Analysis on Efficient Energy Integration Plant Dataset

This project focuses on performing regression analysis on the "Combined Cycle Power Plant" dataset to estimate five types of regression models: multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. The goal is to determine the best model for predicting the electrical energy output of a combined cycle power plant using the determination coefficient.

## Data 

The "Efficient Energy Integration Plan" dataset contains the following features (variables):

 Temperature (T): The temperature measured in Â°C.

Ambient Pressure (AP): The ambient pressure is measured in millibars.

Relative Humidity (RH): The relative humidity measured in percent.

Exhaust Vacuum (V): The exhaust vacuum measured in cm Hg.

Electrical Energy Output (PE): The electrical energy output of the power plant measured in MW.

## Methodology

The regression analysis utilizes five regression models: multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. The determination coefficient (R-squared) is used as the evaluation metric to determine the performance of each model.

## Results

Based on the determination coefficients obtained for each model, the best-performing model for predicting the electrical energy output is the random forest regression. This model achieved the highest determination coefficient (96.16%) among all the models evaluated.
